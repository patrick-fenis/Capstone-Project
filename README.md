# Capstone-Project

For my capstone project I will be creating an upgraded version of my unit 2 project which was a website that
allows someone to keep track of their financial portfolio. The upgrades for this version will be:

        -- Portfolio view will also render real time stock market data to analyze accurately the portfolio's current value as well as the P/L annalysis for the portfolio and individual stocks

        -- I'm going to include a piece of software to render charts for the different sets of stock data

Ill most likely being using the PERN stack but I have not made a final decision yet. 

I will be using seaborne as a new technology to include charts.
